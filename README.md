**We are working on refactoring and making GOMAP compatible with Slurm and MPICH as well as individual nodes. Please wait until this notice is taken down before you start using it.**

## What is GOMAP-Singularity?

**GOMAP-Singularity** is the containerized version of the Gene Ontology Meta Annotator for Plants (**GOMAP**) pipeline. **GOMAP** is a high-throughput pipeline to annotate GO terms to plant protein sequences. The pipeline uses three different approaches to annotate GO terms to plant protein sequences, and compile the annotations together to generate an aggregated dataset. GOMAP uses Python code to run the component tools to generate the GO annotations, and R code to clean and aggregate the GO annotations from the component tools.
