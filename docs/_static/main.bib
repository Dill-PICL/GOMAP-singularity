abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool ({BLAST}), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair ({MSP}) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of {MSP} scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward {DNA} and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long {DNA} sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, {BLAST} is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.}

abstract = {Automated annotation of protein function is challenging. As the number of sequenced genomes rapidly grows, the overwhelming majority of protein products can only be annotated computationally. If computational predictions are to be relied upon, it is crucial that the accuracy of these methods be high. Here we report the results from the first large-scale community-based critical assessment of protein function annotation ({CAFA}) experiment. Fifty-four methods representing the state of the art for protein function prediction were evaluated on a target set of 866 proteins from 11 organisms. Two findings stand out: (i) today's best protein function prediction algorithms substantially outperform widely used first-generation methods, with large gains on all types of targets; and (ii) although the top methods perform well enough to guide experiments, there is considerable need for improvement of currently available tools.}

Since the last update article 2 years ago, we have generated 1182 new families and maintained sequence coverage of the {UniProt} Knowledgebase ({UniProtKB}) at nearly 80\%, despite a 50\% increase in the size of the underlying sequence database. Since our 2012 article describing Pfam, we have also undertaken a comprehensive review of the features that are provided by Pfam over and above the basic family data. For each feature, we determined the relevance, computational burden, usage statistics and the functionality of the feature in a website context. As a consequence of this review, we have removed some features, enhanced others and developed new ones to meet the changing demands of computational biology. Here, we describe the changes to Pfam content. Notably, we now provide family alignments based on four different representative proteome sequence data sets and a new interactive {DNA} search interface. We also discuss the mapping between Pfam and known {3D} structures.}

Recent advances in the software, {HMMER3}, have resulted in a 100-fold speed gain relative to previous versions. It is now feasible to make efficient profile hidden Markov model (profile {HMM}) searches via the web. A {HMMER} web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile {HMM} against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as {RESTful} web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Predicting protein function has become increasingly demanding in the era of next generation sequencing technology. The task to assign a curator-reviewed function to every single sequence is impracticable. Bioinformatics tools, easy to use and able to provide automatic and reliable annotations at a genomic scale, are necessary and urgent. In this scenario, the Gene Ontology has provided the means to standardize the annotation classification with a structured vocabulary which can be easily exploited by computational methods. {RESULTS}: Argot2 is a web-based function prediction tool able to annotate nucleic or protein sequences from small datasets up to entire genomes. It accepts as input a list of sequences in {FASTA} format, which are processed using {BLAST} and {HMMER} searches vs {UniProKB} and Pfam databases respectively; these sequences are then annotated with {GO} terms retrieved from the {UniProtKB}-{GOA} database and the terms are weighted using the e-values from {BLAST} and {HMMER}. The weighted {GO} terms are processed according to both their semantic similarity relations described by the Gene Ontology and their associated score. The algorithm is based on the original idea developed in a previous tool called Argot. The entire engine has been completely rewritten to improve both accuracy and computational efficiency, thus allowing for the annotation of complete genomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: The revised algorithm has been already employed and successfully tested during in-house genome projects of grape and apple, and has proven to have a high precision and recall in all our benchmark conditions. It has also been successfully compared with {Blast2GO}, one of the methods most commonly employed for sequence annotation.

The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using {PacBio} sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation ({SV}) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, {PacBio} transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, {PacBio}'s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using {PacBio} sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with {PacBio} long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using {PacBio} Sequencing alone.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: For most organisms, even if their genome sequence is available, little functional information about individual genes or proteins exists. Several annotation pipelines have been developed for functional analysis based on sequence, 'omics', and literature data. However, researchers encounter little guidance on how well they perform. Here, we used the recently sequenced potato genome as a case study. The potato genome was selected since its genome is newly sequenced and it is a non-model plant even if there is relatively ample information on individual potato genes, and multiple gene expression profiles are available. {RESULTS}: We show that the automatic gene annotations of potato have low accuracy when compared to a "gold standard" based on experimentally validated potato genes. Furthermore, we evaluate six state-of-the-art annotation pipelines and show that their predictions are markedly dissimilar (Jaccard similarity coefficient of 0.27 between pipelines on average). To overcome this discrepancy, we introduce a simple {GO} structure-based algorithm that reconciles the predictions of the different pipelines. We show that the integrated annotation covers more genes, increases by over 50\% the number of highly co-expressed {GO} processes, and obtains much higher agreement with the gold standard. {CONCLUSIONS}: We find that different annotation pipelines produce different results, and show how to integrate them into a unified annotation that is of higher quality than each single pipeline. We offer an improved functional annotation of both {PGSC} and {ITAG} potato gene models, as well as tools that can be applied to additional pipelines and improve annotation in other organisms. This will greatly aid future functional analysis of '-omics' datasets from potato and other organisms with newly sequenced genomes. The new potato annotations are available with this paper.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In response to the rapid growth of available genome sequences, efforts have been made to develop automatic inference methods to functionally characterize them. Pipelines that infer functional annotation are now routinely used to produce new annotations at a genome scale and for a broad variety of species. These pipelines differ widely in their inference algorithms, confidence thresholds and data sources for reasoning. This heterogeneity makes a comparison of the relative merits of each approach extremely complex. The evaluation of the quality of the resultant annotations is also challenging given there is often no existing gold-standard against which to evaluate precision and recall. {RESULTS}: In this paper, we present a pragmatic approach to the study of functional annotations. An ensemble of 12 metrics, describing various aspects of functional annotations, is defined and implemented in a unified framework, which facilitates their systematic analysis and inter-comparison. The use of this framework is demonstrated on three illustrative examples: analysing the outputs of state-of-the-art inference pipelines, comparing electronic versus manual annotation methods, and monitoring the evolution of publicly available functional annotations. The framework is part of the {AIGO} library (http://code.google.com/p/aigo) for the Analysis and the Inter-comparison of the products of Gene Ontology ({GO}) annotation pipelines. The {AIGO} library also provides functionalities to easily load, analyse, manipulate and compare functional annotations and also to plot and export the results of the analysis in various formats. {CONCLUSIONS}: This work is a step toward developing a unified framework for the systematic study of {GO} functional annotations. This framework has been designed so that new metrics on {GO} functional annotations can be added in a very straightforward way.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A major bottleneck in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to proteins. While molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins, their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an increasing role for computational function prediction. However, assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field remain challenging. {RESULTS}: We conducted the second critical assessment of functional annotation ({CAFA}), a timed challenge to assess computational methods that automatically assign protein function. We evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for their ability to predict biological functions using Gene Ontology and gene-disease associations using Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3681 proteins from 18 species. {CAFA2} featured expanded analysis compared with {CAFA1}, with regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics. To review progress in the field, the analysis compared the best methods from {CAFA1} to those of {CAFA2}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The top-performing methods in {CAFA2} outperformed those from {CAFA1}. This increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions, and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies. While there was methodological improvement between {CAFA1} and {CAFA2}, the interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods remain context-dependent.}

abstract = {Understanding protein function is one of the keys to understanding life at the molecular level. It is also important in the context of human disease because many conditions arise as a consequence of alterations of protein function. The recent availability of relatively inexpensive sequencing technology has resulted in thousands of complete or partially sequenced genomes with millions of functionally uncharacterized proteins. Such a large volume of data, combined with the lack of high-throughput experimental assays to functionally annotate proteins, attributes to the growing importance of automated function prediction. Here, we study proteins annotated by Gene Ontology ({GO}) terms and estimate the accuracy of functional transfer from protein sequence only. We find that the transfer of {GO} terms by pairwise sequence alignments is only moderately accurate, showing a surprisingly small influence of sequence identity ({SID}) in a broad range (30-100\%). We developed and evaluated a new predictor of protein function, functional annotator ({FANN}), from amino acid sequence. The predictor exploits a multioutput neural network framework which is well suited to simultaneously modeling dependencies between functional terms. Experiments provide evidence that {FANN}-{GO} (predictor of {GO} terms; available from http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/predrag) outperforms standard methods such as transfer by global or local {SID} as well as {GOtcha}, a method that incorporates the structure of {GO}.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The last decade has seen a remarkable growth in protein databases. This growth comes at a price: a growing number of submitted protein sequences lack functional annotation. Approximately 32\% of sequences submitted to the most comprehensive protein database {UniProtKB} are labelled as 'Unknown protein' or alike. Also the functionally annotated parts are reported to contain 30-40\% of errors. Here, we introduce a high-throughput tool for more reliable functional annotation called Protein {ANNotation} with Z-score ({PANNZER}). {PANNZER} predicts Gene Ontology ({GO}) classes and free text descriptions about protein functionality. {PANNZER} uses weighted k-nearest neighbour methods with statistical testing to maximize the reliability of a functional annotation. {RESULTS}: Our results in free text description line prediction show that we outperformed all competing methods with a clear margin. In {GO} prediction we show clear improvement to our older method that performed well in {CAFA} 2011 challenge. \copyright The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: High-throughput experiments such as microarray hybridizations often yield long lists of genes found to share a certain characteristic such as differential expression. Exploring Gene Ontology ({GO}) annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of {GO} terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of {GO} because they analyze each term in isolation. Especially the fact that annotations are inherited from more specific descendant terms can result in certain types of false-positive results with potentially misleading biological interpretation, a phenomenon which we term the inheritance problem. {RESULTS}: We present here a novel approach to analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation that determines overrepresentation of terms in the context of annotations to the term's parents. This approach reduces the dependencies between the individual term's measurements, and thereby avoids producing false-positive results owing to the inheritance problem. {ROC} analysis using study sets with overrepresented {GO} terms showed a clear advantage for our approach over the standard algorithm with respect to the inheritance problem. Although there can be no gold standard for exploratory methods such as analysis of {GO} term overrepresentation, analysis of biological datasets suggests that our algorithm tends to identify the core {GO} terms that are most characteristic of the dataset being analyzed.}

abstract = {Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental tools for characterization of genetic and functional variation. These resources facilitate the determination of biological processes and support translation of research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here we report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.}

We also compared the quality of our newly-derived annotations with the existing Gramene and Phytozome functional annotation sets by comparing all three to a manually annotated gold standard set of 1,619 genes where annotations were primarily inferred from direct assay or mutant phenotype. Evaluations based on the gold standard indicate that our new annotation set is measurably more accurate than those from Phytozome and Gramene. To derive this new high-coverage, high-confidence annotation set we used sequence-similarity and protein-domain-presence methods as well as mixed-method pipelines that developed for the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation ({CAFA}) challenge.

abstract = {Recent times have seen an enormous growth of "omics" data, of which high-throughput gene expression data are arguably the most important from a functional perspective. Despite huge improvements in computational techniques for the functional classification of gene sequences, common similarity-based methods often fall short of providing full and reliable functional information. Recently, the combination of comparative genomics with approaches in functional genomics has received considerable interest for gene function analysis, leveraging both gene expression based guilt-by-association methods and annotation efforts in closely related model organisms. Besides the identification of missing genes in pathways, these methods also typically enable the discovery of biological regulators (i.e., transcription factors or signaling genes). A previously built guilt-by-association method is {MORPH}, which was proven to be an efficient algorithm that performs particularly well in identifying and prioritizing missing genes in plant metabolic pathways. Here, we present {MorphDB}, a resource where {MORPH}-based candidate genes for large-scale functional annotations (Gene Ontology, {MapMan} bins) are integrated across multiple plant species. Besides a gene centric query utility, we present a comparative network approach that enables researchers to efficiently browse {MORPH} predictions across functional gene sets and species, facilitating efficient gene discovery and candidate gene prioritization. {MorphDB} is available at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/morphdb/{morphDB}/index/. We also provide a toolkit, named "{MORPH} bulk" (https://github.com/arzwa/morph-bulk), for running {MORPH} in bulk mode on novel data sets, enabling researchers to apply {MORPH} to their own species of interest.}
